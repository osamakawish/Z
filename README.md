# Z
A set of languages that provide alternative to XAML, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

The point is to create a language which is simple for beginners, but in which the different parts are also unified in a very straightforward and intuitive way. Currently, only the documentation files have any content. That is, they contain the plan for the details of what the language and its code will potentially look like.

The documentation files are of the path "/Documentation/X/_X.md" relative to this root directory. Again, they are the only files with any content as of August 2023. I will work on it when I can afford to find time to do so.
